Governance (Patrick)
How we do business today is point – point, and how each actor does business through each other. In many cases we reconcile data after the fact. We have a problem today with 2 government agencies talking to each other and putting together a MOU or IAA. 
-	Dispute Resolution
-	Exception Process
-	Establishing rules of how we play the game upfront for Blockchain is going to be very different from the traditional model
o	No single owner
o	Data is shared
o	Rules for on-ramp / off-ramp are different or doesn’t exist in current models in most cases
o	Distributed responsibility

-	Some of the areas Governance should consider and will be different from the traditional model. As described above, the traditional models assume a single system owned and managed by a single entity (an organization or a division within the organization). The Blockchain implementation questions this very basic premise and requires a paradigm shift. We will now have to consider the operations as a collective and cooperative, much like a Home Owner's Association (HOA) where each owner has a vested interest in the HOA while their own independant interest in the 'consortium' and would like to arrive at a consensus for all HOA related matters.

When we are considering Governance in the model described above, the following components of governance also take a different flavor and must be carefully considered and crafted for a succesfull implementation of a Blockchain solution: (Venkat)
o	Risk management: Risks for a Blockchain Implementation takes multiple layers and have to be managed and mitigated accordingly. The risks posed by the overall implementation must be shared and dealt with by all the parties on the network. Consider the risk of burglary within the community that is managed by the HOA. Won't all the householders be interested in mitigating this risk?

o	Change management: In addition to the traditional change management, Governance should also take into account changes to the Blockchain Network affecting each participant's own enclave. The reverse also holds true, each participant should ensure any changes to their enclave doesn't mess with the blockchain implementation or else have the governance board weigh in on the changes. An additional component that can change could be the rules around the validation of the block itself. In some cases, these rules take the form of a SmartContract. What happens when the rules have to change? How does it affect the 'posture' of each member? What happens to the blocks in the chain before and after the change?

o	Release management: Release Management becomes a component of change management ahd deals with when and how the releases make into production. This is similar to the HOA resurfacing the main road in the HOA or rolling out a new internet service to all the homes in the HOA. Planning and approvals have to be part of release management.

o	Security management
	Key Management (Standards)
o	IT service management
o	Stakeholder management

Do we want to start talking about intersection with Government? - 
Do we want to talk about projects in-flight?
